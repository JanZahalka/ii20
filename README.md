# II-20
# About
II-20 is a multimedia analytics system for intelligent analytic categorization of image collections. II-20 loads in your dataset, and allows you to define your categories of relevance - called buckets - to which you add images that you deem relevant. II-20's intelligent AI model learns to understand the buckets, providing you with instant suggestions of relevant items. You can add/delete/redefine/update buckets at any time, making II-20's analytics truly flexible.

There are two modes in which you can conduct your analytics - a classic grid interface, and a playful "Tetris" interface where images flow from the top to the buckets on the bottom (useful if you want to focus on individual images, or just want a change of pace). The process is fully interactive, and the system is responsive even on large data (hundreds of thousands of images to millions).

The system is to be presented at the IEEE VIS conference (VAST papers), and the paper will be
