## About II-20
II-20 is a multimedia analytics system for intelligent analytic categorization of image collections. II-20 loads in your dataset, and allows you to define your categories of relevance - called buckets - to which you add images that you deem relevant. II-20's intelligent AI model learns to understand the buckets, providing you with instant suggestions of relevant items. You can add/delete/redefine/update buckets at any time, making II-20's analytics truly flexible.

There are two modes in which you can conduct your analytics - a classic grid interface, and a playful "Tetris" interface where images flow from the top to the buckets on the bottom (useful if you want to focus on individual images, or just want a change of pace). The process is fully interactive, and the system is responsive even on large data (hundreds of thousands of images to millions).

## Installation
II-20 is implemented as a Django web app utilizing scientific and deep learning Python libraries in the backend, with the front end being realized through React.js. The software was tested on Ubuntu and Mac OS. I am not aware of any specific reasons it shouldn't run on Windows, but I have not tested that. In this section, we describe how to get started with analytics on demo data.

1. Clone this repository. In further text, `$II20_ROOT` denotes the root directory of the repository. `cd` to it.
2. Download the demo dataset from here: **LINK!**. Store it wherever convenient for you, unzip, note the absolute path to the dataset (the `yfcc10k` directory), further denoted as `$YFCC10K_ROOT`.
3. Install the prerequisites: `sudo apt-get install virtualenv mysql-server libmysqlclient-dev` (on Ubuntu, if using a different distro or Mac OS, install the equivalents).
4. Create the virtual environment: `virtualenv -p python3 env_ii20`.
5. Activate the virtual environment: `source env_ii20/bin/activate`.
6. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
7. `cd scripts`
8. `python generate_secret_key.py`
9. Create the app's DB user on II-20's side: `python db_superuser.py` (and note the DB user info, further denoted by `<db_username>` and `<db_password>`).
10. Create the MySQL database used by the system and the DB user on the DB side:
```
sudo mysql -u root
CREATE DATABASE ii20;
CREATE USER '<db_username>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<db_password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ii20.* TO '<db_username>'@'localhost';
exit
```
